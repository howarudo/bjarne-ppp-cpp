1. **What are the two parts of a class, as described in the chapter?**

2. **What is the difference between the interface and the implementation in a class?**

3. **What are the limitations and problems of the `struct Date` from §8.4.1?**

4. **Why is a constructor used for the `Date` type instead of an `init_day()` function?**

5. **What is an invariant? Give examples.**

6. **When should functions be put in the class definition, and when should they be defined outside the class? Why?**

7. **What is a default constructor and when do we need one?**

8. **What is a default member initializer?**

9. **When should operator overloading be used in a program? Give a list of operators that you might want to overload (each with a reason). Which ones can you define in C++?**

10. **Why should the public interface to a class be as small as possible?**

11. **What does adding `const` to a member function do?**

12. **Why are “helper functions” best placed outside the class definition?**

13. **How does an `enum class` differ from a “plain” `enum`?**
